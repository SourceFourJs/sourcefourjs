#summary fgl_zoom

= Introduction =

Too many times I go on site and see lots of repeated 4gl code tied up in zoom/lookup/query window routines.

fgl_zoom is an example of a generic zoom window routine that you can use repeatedly for most of your zoom/lookup windows.  It not only cuts down on your code base but also allows standardisation of all your zoom/lookup windows resulting in not only a better application but also making it easier to maintain by meaning that you only have to make changes once rather than repeating in every zoom/lookup

I have added fgl_zoom to the downloads area here.  This is the first release.

It is intended to be used with Genero 2.30 or above.  It can be made to work with 2.21 but as it uses IMPORT FGL it is not practical to reengineer it to work with earlier Genero versions.

I'll add notes about the functionality here in due course.
