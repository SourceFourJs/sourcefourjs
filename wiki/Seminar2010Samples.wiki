#summary Details about programs Reuben demonstrated as part of 2010 Four J's Asia Pacific seminar tour

= Introduction =

The following lists where you will find the sources I used as part of my demonstrations on the 2010 Four J's Asia Pacific Tour.

A number of them were taken from the Four J's demo directories so I will direct you to the appropriate demo in the 2.30 release which is now available rather than duplicating them here.

The number beside the entry is just something I added in the Genero Studio project workspace to get the programs in the order I intended to display them

       Add the following to any DISPLAY ARRAY and compile in Genero 2.30 or later.  (you will need to also add a DEFINE dnd ui.DragDrop).  Run and then Drag & Drop one or more rows from this array to Excel.  Also select multiple rows, click editcopy and paste into Excel.

       TODO

  * *91 Menu Action Close*

    Compile and run this program in both 2.21 and 2.30, observe the difference in behaviour when you click on the red-cross.  In 2.21, int_flag would be set and the MENU would exit without setting the result variable.  Typical 4gl didn't cater for this case.
{{{
MAIN
DEFINE result CHAR(1)

   MENU "" ATTRIBUTES(COMMENT="Menu with two options", STYLE="dialog")
      COMMAND "Yes"
         LET result = "Y"
         EXIT MENU
      COMMAND "No"
         LET result = "N"
         EXIT MENU
      --ON ACTION close
         --LET result = "C"
         --EXIT MENU
   END MENU

   -- With 2.21 you can click on the red cross and int_flag will be set to 1 and result will be NULL!!!

   DISPLAY SFMT("int_flag=%1", int_flag)
   DISPLAY SFMT("result=%1", result )
   
END MAIN
