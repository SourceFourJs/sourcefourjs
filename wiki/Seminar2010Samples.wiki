#summary Programs Reuben demonstrated as part of 2010 Four J's Asia Pacific seminar tour

= Introduction =

The following lists where you will find the sources I used as part of my demonstrations on the 2010 Four J's Asia Pacific Tour.

A number of them were taken from the Four J's demo directories so I will direct you to the appropriate demo in the 2.30 release which is now available rather than duplicating them here.

The number beside the entry is just something I added in the Genero Studio project workspace to get the programs in the order I intended to display them
