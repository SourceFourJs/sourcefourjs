DOM Helpers Module

This module was originally created for my IIUG 2012 Conference talk -
 "RESTful Genero Applications" so that code samples were not cluttered
with DOM queries. It has turned out to quite useful for everyday Genero
DOM programming.

It was inspired by an article titled:

 "Effective XML processing with DOM and XPath in Perl"
(http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-domprl/)

A paragraph in the article best sums up by it is useful:

"Your experience using DOM will be significantly improved if you 
 follow a few basic principles:

  * Do not use DOM to traverse the document

  * Whenever possible, use XPath to find nodes or traverse the document

  * Use a library of higher-level functions to make DOM use easier"

This module attempts to provide some higher-level functions in Genero
that make working with the XML DOM easier similar to x-domprl.
